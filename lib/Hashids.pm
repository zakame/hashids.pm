=head1 NAME

Hashids - generate short hashes from numbers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Hashids;
    my $hashids = Hashids->new('this is my salt');

    # encrypt a single number
    my $hash = $hashids->encode(123);          # 'YDx'
    my $number = $hashids->decode('YDx');      # 123

    # or a list
    $hash = $hashids->encode(1, 2, 3);         # 'laHquq'
    my @numbers = $hashids->decode('laHquq');  # (1, 2, 3)

    # also get results in an arrayref
    my $numbers = $hashids->decode('laHquq');  # [1, 2, 3]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a port of the Hashids JavaScript library for Perl.

Hashids was designed for use in URL shortening, tracking stuff,
validating accounts or making pages private (through abstraction.)
Instead of showing items as C<1>, C<2>, or C<3>, you could show them as
C<b9iLXiAa>, C<EATedTBy>, and C<Aaco9cy5>.  Hashes depend on your salt
value.

B<IMPORTANT>: This implementation follows the v1.0.0 API release of
hashids.js.  An older API of hashids.js (v0.1.4) can be found in Hashids
version 0.08 and earlier releases; if you have code that depends on this
API version, please use a tool like L<Carton> to pin your Hashids
install to the older version.

This implementation is also compatible with the v0.3.x hashids.js API.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $hashids = Hashids->new();

Make a new Hashids object.  This constructor accepts a few options:

    my $hashids = Hashids->new(
        salt          => 'this is my salt',
        alphabet      => 'abcdefghijklmnop',
        minHashLength => 8
    );

=over

=item  salt

Salt string, this should be unique per Hashids object.  Must be either
as long or shorter than the alphabet length, as a longer salt string
than the alphabet introduces false collisions.

=item  alphabet

Alphabet set to use.  This is optional as Hashids comes with a default
set suitable for URL shortening.  Should you choose to supply a custom
alphabet, make sure that it is at least 16 characters long, has no
spaces, and only has unique characters.

=item  minHashLength

Minimum hash length.  Use this to control how long the generated hash
string should be.

=back

You can also construct with just a single argument for the salt, leaving
the alphabet and minHashLength at their defaults:

    my $hashids = Hashids->new('this is my salt');

=head2 encode

    my $hash = $hashids->encode($x, [$y, $z, ...]);

Encode a single number (or a list of numbers) into a hash string.

=head2 encrypt

Alias for L</encode>, for compatibility with v0.3.x hashids.js API.

=head2 encode_hex

    my $hash = $hashids->encode_hex('deadbeef');

Encode a hex string into a hash string.

=head2 decode

    my $number = $hashids->decode($hash);

Decode a hash string into its number (or numbers.)  Returns either a
simple scalar if it is a single number, an arrayref of numbers if it
decrypted a set, or C<undef> if given bad input.  Use L<perlfunc/ref> on
the result to ensure proper usage.

You can also retrieve the result as a proper list by assigning it to an
array variable, by doing so you will always get a list of one or more
numbers that are decrypted from the hash, or the empty list if none were
found:

    my @numbers = $hashids->decode($hash);

=head2 decrypt

Alias for this L</decode>, for compatibility with v0.3.x hashids.js API.

=head2 decode_hex

    my $hex_string = $hashids->decode_hex($hash);

Opposite of L</encode_hex>.  Unlike L</decode>, this will always return
a string, including the empty string if the hash is invalid.
