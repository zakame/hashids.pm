# NAME

Hashids - generate short hashes from numbers

# SYNOPSIS

    use Hashids;
    my $hashids = Hashids->new('this is my salt');

    # encrypt a single number
    my $hash = $hashids->encode(123);          # 'YDx'
    my $number = $hashids->decode('YDx');      # 123

    # or a list
    $hash = $hashids->encode(1, 2, 3);         # 'laHquq'
    my @numbers = $hashids->decode('laHquq');  # (1, 2, 3)

    # also get results in an arrayref
    my $numbers = $hashids->decode('laHquq');  # [1, 2, 3]

# DESCRIPTION

This is a port of the Hashids JavaScript library for Perl.

Hashids was designed for use in URL shortening, tracking stuff,
validating accounts or making pages private (through abstraction.)
Instead of showing items as `1`, `2`, or `3`, you could show them as
`b9iLXiAa`, `EATedTBy`, and `Aaco9cy5`.  Hashes depend on your salt
value.

**IMPORTANT**: This implementation follows the v1.0.0 API release of
hashids.js.  An older API of hashids.js (v0.1.4) can be found in Hashids
version 0.08 and earlier releases; if you have code that depends on this
API version, please use a tool like [Carton](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton) to pin your Hashids
install to the older version.

This implementation is also compatible with the v0.3.x hashids.js API.

# METHODS

## new

    my $hashids = Hashids->new();

Make a new Hashids object.  This constructor accepts a few options:

    my $hashids = Hashids->new(
        salt          => 'this is my salt',
        alphabet      => 'abcdefghijklmnop',
        minHashLength => 8
    );

- salt

    Salt string, this should be unique per Hashids object.  Must be either
    as long or shorter than the alphabet length, as a longer salt string
    than the alphabet introduces false collisions.

- alphabet

    Alphabet set to use.  This is optional as Hashids comes with a default
    set suitable for URL shortening.  Should you choose to supply a custom
    alphabet, make sure that it is at least 16 characters long, has no
    spaces, and only has unique characters.

- minHashLength

    Minimum hash length.  Use this to control how long the generated hash
    string should be.

You can also construct with just a single argument for the salt, leaving
the alphabet and minHashLength at their defaults:

    my $hashids = Hashids->new('this is my salt');

## encode

    my $hash = $hashids->encode($x, [$y, $z, ...]);

Encode a single number (or a list of numbers) into a hash string.

## encrypt

Alias for ["encode"](#encode), for compatibility with v0.3.x hashids.js API.

## encode\_hex

    my $hash = $hashids->encode_hex('deadbeef');

Encode a hex string into a hash string.

## decode

    my $number = $hashids->decode($hash);

Decode a hash string into its number (or numbers.)  Returns either a
simple scalar if it is a single number, an arrayref of numbers if it
decrypted a set, or `undef` if given bad input.  Use ["ref" in perlfunc](https://metacpan.org/pod/perlfunc#ref) on
the result to ensure proper usage.

You can also retrieve the result as a proper list by assigning it to an
array variable, by doing so you will always get a list of one or more
numbers that are decrypted from the hash, or the empty list if none were
found:

    my @numbers = $hashids->decode($hash);

## decrypt

Alias for this ["decode"](#decode), for compatibility with v0.3.x hashids.js API.

## decode\_hex

    my $hex_string = $hashids->decode_hex($hash);

Opposite of ["encode\_hex"](#encode_hex).  Unlike ["decode"](#decode), this will always return
a string, including the empty string if the hash is invalid.
